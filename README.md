# NeuralNetwork_UTKFace
trained NN model based on UTKFace dataset utilizing Keras and Tensorflow

## Tasks completed
1. Utilized/Mobilized Keras and Tensorflow to train NN model. Data preprocesing done using grayscaling and one-hot-encoding.
2. Tuned parameters (optimizers, nEpoch, loss functions and regularization methods) to maximize F1-score.
